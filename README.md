# weather-dashboard

GOAL:: Pull data from a weather website so I can search a city and it will display the city, the weather, and the weather for the next 5 days. There should also be a recent searches feature so I can see what cities I have previously looked at. When I reload the page, local storage should still save the recent searches as well as the city I most recently searched and its weather results.

1/2/22 :: So far I have a baseline setup. I have a basic wireframing so my html is complete and my css is somewhat complete. It looks similar to the demo, just with less css. 

REMINDER:: DO NOT FORGET TO ADD LINKS TO BOOTSTRAP
